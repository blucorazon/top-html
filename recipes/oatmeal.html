        <li>100 grams granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Preheat the oven: </span>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking
            sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Cream the butter and sugar: </span>In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon or
            spatula to cream the softened butter with the brown sugar and
            granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This may take a few minutes of vigorous mixing.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Add eggs and vanilla: </span> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each
            egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Combine dry ingredients: </span> In a separate bowl, whisk together the
            flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Mix dry and wet ingredients: </span>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the
            wet mixture, stirring until just combined.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Add oats and raisins: </span> Fold in the oats and raisins, mixing until
            evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Scoop the dough: </span> Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded
            tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Bake: </span>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the
            edges are lightly golden. The centers will still look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they
            cool.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Cool: </span>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes
            before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
