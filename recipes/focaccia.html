    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pan: Use non-stick vegetable oil spray to lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Drizzle about 2
            tablespoons (25g) of the olive oil atop the spray</li>

        <li>Proof the yeast: Set aside some of the water and activate the yeast in the water with a pinch of
            sugar or honey. You'll see when it's ready and it won't take long.</li>

        <li>Knead the dough: Combine the remaining 35g of olive oil with the rest of the dough ingredients. Knead for
            five minutes by hand or with a mixer.</li>

        <li>First dough rise: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased mixing bowl, and cover with a damp
            towel. Let the dough rest for 45-60 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.</li>

        <li>Second dough rise: Scoop the dough into the prepared pan, cover it, and let it rise again at room
            temperature for
            30-60 minutes. During the second rise, preheat the oven to 375<span>&#176;</span>F.</li>

        <li>Prepare the dough: Poke deep dents into the dough with your fingers all over the surface of the dough.
            Drizzle
            a tablespoon or two of olive oil evenly over the top of the dough and sprinkle evenly with the fresh
            rosemary (and sea salt, optionally).</li>

        <li>Bake: Bake until the bread is golden brown, 25-30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove from oven: Wait 5 minutes before turning the loaf onto a rack.</li>
    </ol>
