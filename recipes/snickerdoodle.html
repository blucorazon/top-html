        <li>Total: 30-35 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>227 grams unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>200 grams granulated sugar</li>
        <li>50 grams packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>5 milliliters vanilla extract</li>
        <li>300 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>5 grams cream of tartar</li>
        <li>5 grams baking soda</li>
        <li>3 grams salt</li>
        <li>15 grams ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>50 grams granulated sugar (for rolling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preheat the Oven: </span>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two
            baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cream the Butter and Sugars: </span>In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon or
            spatula to cream the softened butter with 200 grams of granulated sugar and the brown sugar until the
            mixture is light and fluffy. This may take a few minutes of vigorous mixing.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Eggs and Vanilla: </span>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each
            egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine Dry Ingredients: </span>In a separate bowl, whisk together the
            flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mix Dry and Wet Ingredients: </span>Gradually add the dry ingredients to
            the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Prepare Cinnamon Sugar: </span>In a small bowl, mix the 15 grams of ground
            cinnamon with 50 grams of granulated sugar.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Form and Coat the Dough: </span>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, form dough
            into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter). Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until well coated.
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arrange and Bake: </span>Place the coated dough balls on the prepared
            baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the
            edges are lightly golden. The centers will still look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they
            cool.</li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cool: </span>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes
            before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
